Predict Health Insurance Owners who will be interested in Vehicle Insurance


**Problem Statement**

Our client is an Insurance company that has provided Health Insurance to its customers. Now they need your help in building a model to predict whether the policyholders (customers) from the past year will also be interested in Vehicle Insurance provided by the company.
An insurance policy is an arrangement by which a company undertakes to guarantee compensation for specified loss, damage, illness, or death in return for the payment of a fixed premium. A premium is money the customer must regularly pay to an insurance company for this guarantee.
For example, you may pay a premium of Rs. 5000 each year for a health insurance cover of Rs. 200,000/- so that if, God forbid, you fall ill and need to be hospitalized in that year, the insurance provider company will bear the cost of hospitalization etc. for upto Rs. 200,000. Suppose you are wondering how the company can take such high hospitalization costs when it charges a premium of only Rs. 5000/-. In that case, the concept of probabilities comes into the picture. For example, like you, maybe 100 customers paying a premium of Rs. 5000 every year, but only a few of them (say 2-3) would get hospitalized that year and not everyone. This way, everyone shares the risk of everyone else.
Just like medical insurance, there is vehicle insurance where every year customer needs to pay a premium of a certain amount to the insurance provider company so that in case of an unfortunate accident by the vehicle, the insurance provider company will provide compensation (called ‚Äòsum assured‚Äô) to the customer.
Building a model to predict whether a customer would be interested in Vehicle Insurance is extremely helpful for the company because it can plan its communication strategy accordingly to reach out to those customers and optimize its business model and revenue.
Now, to predict, whether the customer would be interested in Vehicle insurance, you have information about demographics (gender, age, region code type), Vehicles (Vehicle Age, Damage), Policy (Premium, sourcing channel), etc.
